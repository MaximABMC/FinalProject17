# FinalProject17
The game is based on minecraft. The user will type to mine certain blocks. These blocks will then be sent to their inventory. When the player has enough wood blocks in their inventory they will be able to craft a wood pickaxe. This pickaxe will mine automatically for them. Eventually they will have enough blocks to craft a stone pickaxe. The stone pickaxe mines more blocks per second than the wood pickaxe. Eventually the player will craft a iron pickaxe then a gold one and finally a diamond pickaxe. Once the diamond pickaxe is unlocked the player will be able to fight the Ender Dragon. The Ender Dragon is the final boss of the game and defeating it is how you win.
