# FinalProject17
The game is based on the crafting system in Minecraft.  The game has blocks and pickaxes.  The player starts with no blocks and only their hand to use as a pickaxe.  However they can mine wood.  The wood is then sent to the player's inventory With that wood they can craft a wooden pickaxe.  The wooden pickaxe mines faster than just the player's hand.  Eventually the player will craft a stone pickaxe.  The stone pickaxe is even more powerful than the wooden pickaxe.  There are multiple tiers of pickaxes for the player to craft.  The objective of the game is to craft the final pickaxe of the game, the diamond pickaxe.
